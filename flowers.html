        <font face="Arial"><font size="+1">Flowers brighten our world
            and everybody loves them. But of course that is not their
            purpose in life. They have evolved as a vehicle for sexual
            reproduction in plants. Plants can reproduce in other ways,
            as any gardener knows - for example clumps of perennial
            plants will gradually expand, some plants (buttercups for
            example) put out runners which root to form new plants, and
            the gardener can take cuttings or split off side-bulbs from
            others. These methods all produce plants which are
            genetically identical to the parent plant. In contrast,
            pollination of a flower combines pollen from one plant with
            what are effectively eggs from another, so that the
            resulting seeds combine properties from both parents. This
            has the advantage of introducing <i>variation</i> into the
            population. Try asking a child if they can think of reasons
            why variations might be helpful to a plant.<br>

            Most children will enjoy collecting flowers from the garden
            or (in moderation) from nature and displaying them in
            various ways. Most obviously they can be arranged in a small
            vase <img moz-do-not-send="true"
              src="Images/flower_vase.jpg" alt="Vase of flowers"

            on a table or windowsill. However, there is something rather
            magical about flowers floating in a bowl of water. At the
            same time, children's attention can be drawn to the great
            variety in the form of flowers. A simple flower - a lily is
            a good example - has several easily identified components,
            as shown in the diagram on the left, each of which has a
            clear role to play. <img moz-do-not-send="true"
              src="Images/flower_structure.jpg" alt="Flower structure"
              height="289" width="425" vspace="20" hspace="10"
              border="2" align="left">The most important features are
            the <i>petals</i>, often brightly coloured to attract
            pollinating insects, the <i>stamens</i> which carry pollen
            in <i>anthers</i> at their tips, and the central <i>stigma</i>
            which rises from the <i>ovary</i> beneath. Bees and other
            pollinating insects, attracted by the colour and scent of
            the flower, and often in search of the sweet <i>nectar</i>
            exuded at the base of the flower, brush against the anthers
            and become dusted with pollen, which they then transfer to
            another flower, where some may be deposited on the stigma.
            From here the pollen burrows its way down to the ovary where
            it can fertilise one of the eggs contained there, eventually
            forming a seed from which a new plant can grow. Children can
            be encouraged to watch insects going about the business of
            pollination. Can they see the yellow dust of pollen which
            sticks to them?<br>
            <br>
            Many flowers do not look like the diagram here. Especially
            common are flowers (such as daisies, sunflowers and
            marigolds) which have a central complex like a pincushion.
            This contains many ovaries grouped together, and so is very
            efficient at producing seeds. If you have a <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="magnifier.html">magnifying
              glass</a> then this will help children to see the details
            inside different flowers.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to displaying flowers in a vase or bowl, flowers
            or individual petals can be used to make collage pictures,
            as discussed in our section on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="collage.html">Nature collage</a>. You can also bring
            art and science together by conducting a simple experiment.
            Plants lose water through their leaves and petals, and need
            to suck up water to replace this, or they will wilt. You can
            see this process (called transpiration) in operation very
            clearly if a white flower (carnation, chrysanthemum or rose,
            for example) is placed in a small vase of water strongly
            coloured with food dye or ink. After a few hours, veins of
            colour should appear in the petals and these will get
            stronger over a period of a day or two. The resulting
            flowers are striking, if rather weird, and children will
            find them fascinating. You can find further details, and
            some examples of the results, <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            <br>
            Having learned that the purpose of flowers is to produce
            seeds, children might naturally want to see an example. Some
            plants, especially those that rely on wind to disperse them,
            display their seeds prominently when they are ripe - a
            dandelion "clock" is a good example - but many keep the
            seeds hidden within a pod or seed capsule. Good examples are
            peas, beans and poppies. You can encourage children to close
            the cycle by collecting some seeds and sowing them, though
            they might have to wait until next year to see the results.
            Large seeds can be germinated in jars so that the
            development of the seedling can be clearly seen - see our <a
