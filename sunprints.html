          <font size="+1">Sun printing is a process which will fascinate
            children. Using light-sensitive paper (often called
            "sunprint paper" or "cyanotype paper") it is easy to make
            beautiful white-on-blue prints of flat natural objects such
            as leaves, flowers or feathers. The images will appear
            "magically" in just a few minutes on a sunny day, and the
            resulting images can be displayed as artworks or used for a
            variety of craft activities.<br>
            <br>
            You will need to invest a little money in this, although a
            cheaper version which does not use photo-sensitive paper is
            mentioned below. The basic idea is to collect some
            interesting natural objects, arrange them on a sheet of the
            sunprint paper, expose them to sunlight for a few minutes
            (or to a cloudy sky for longer) and then to wash off the
            chemicals and leave them to dry. The process is described in
            detail at <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="https://runwildmychild.com/sun-print-nature-art/">this</a>
            web site, which also explains what is happening. The prints
            will be much sharper if the natural items are held down flat
            against the paper during exposure to the sun, so it is worth
            placing a sheet of perspex or glass on top. You might want
            to invest in one of the "Sunprint kits" supplied by the
            Lawrence Hall of Science, which includes a perspex sheet.
            You can easily find these for sale online, for example from
            Amazon.<br>

            Not only will this activity highlight the delicate and
            varied form of leaves, flowers, seed heads and feathers, but
            it may also interest older children in chemistry. The
            ultraviolet rays included in sunlight are reacting with a
            chemical in the paper. Initially this bleaches the blue
            colour of the photosensitive paper, but when washed in water
            a second chemical reaction takes place which turns the
            exposed areas deep blue, whilst the chemicals in the
            unexposed areas, which were protected from the sun by your
            natural objects, are washed away by the water, leaving white
            paper behind.<br>
            <br>
            The pictures produced can be displayed as they are or
            framed, but they can also be used to make attractive book
            covers, or to cover small boxes used to store "treasures" or
            to contain presents. If you want to do this, then take care
            to buy sufficiently large sheets of sunprint paper. Some of
            those available for sale are quite small.<br>
            <br>
            If the cost of photosensitive paper (typically Â£1-2 each for
            an 8x10 inch or A4 sheet) deters you then there is a much
            cheaper approach using coloured sugar paper, which simply
            relies on the fact that the colour in the paper will fade in
            sunlight. This takes a good deal longer (e.g. a day or more
            in full sun) and will not produce images with the same level
            of clarity, but it is a lot cheaper. You can find a guide to
            this approach from the Natural History Museum <a
