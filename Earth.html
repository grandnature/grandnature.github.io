                  home and for all we know it may be the only place in
                  the Universe which hosts life. Although it is a big
                  place, humans have now come to dominate the planet to
                  such an extent that we are changing it in fundamental
                  ways. It is therefore very important that young people
                  understand and treasure the Earth, since without a
                  commitment to forego some of the damaging lifestyle
                  choices which have become commonplace in the developed
                  world the outlook for the living world is bleak.</font><br>
