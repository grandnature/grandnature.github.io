                it may be the only place in the Universe which hosts
                life. Although it is a big place, humans have now come
                to dominate the planet to such an extent that we are
                changing it in fundamental ways. It is therefore very
                important that young people understand and treasure the
                Earth, since without a commitment to forego some of the
                damaging lifestyle choices which have become commonplace
                in the developed world the outlook for the living world
                is bleak.<br>
