          <font size="+1">Leaves come in many shapes and sizes, and the
            veins which transport water and nutrients to and from the
            stems of the plant form beautiful branching patterns. (It is
            interesting to ask children what they think the function of
            these veins might be. It's really not very different to the
            veins in our own bodies, which you can point out to them.)<br>
            <br>
            These patterns can be transferred onto paper very simply, by
            painting the underside of a leaf and then pressing it onto
            the paper surface using a roller, a pad of paper or just
            (rather messily!) the fingers. Best results will be obtained
            with strongly coloured paint, such as acrylic or poster
            paints, or inks. Be sure that whatever you use will wash off
            hands and clothes with water, though. Watercolours will also
            work if they are strong enough - e.g. from tubes rather than
            from watercolour "pans".<br>
            <br>
            There is no need to restrict yourself to one colour per
            leaf. Especially in autumn you can encourage children to
            notice the range of colours in the leaves - greens, yellows,
            oranges, reds, browns and even purples. They could apply
            several areas of colour to a single leaf and let them mix on
            the leaf before printing. Notice what happens when two
            colours combine. This way they can learn about colour
            mixing.<br>

            Here are some other ideas for things to do with leaves:-<br>

        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Go on a leaf hunt,
                  collecting leaves of different shapes, sizes and
                  colours. This is especially good in the autumn, of
                  course.<br>
                </font></font></li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Leaf prints can be
                  used to construct a larger picture, such as a face or
                  a butterfly. Details can be added with a felt tip pen.</font></font></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Leaves can also be
                  pressed to preserve them. This can be done with a
                  flower press, but inserting leaves between two sheets
                  of paper inside a book or beneath a heavy weight will
                  work perfectly well. The same thing can be done with
                  petals, of course. Such pressed items can then be used
                  in collages, stuck on with any suitable glue, such as
                  PVA glue or wallpaper paste.</font></font></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Leaves can also be
                  used to create mobiles, wreaths, masks and many other
                  items which children can play with or display in their
                  bedroom. Ideas can be found at web sites such as <a
