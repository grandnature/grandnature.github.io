          <font size="+1">Trees are the giants of the plant world and
            many species of tree will outlive any human. So, planting a
            tree is a gift for future generations. Furthermore, since
            trees lock up substantial quantities of carbon, they help to
            combat climate change. For children, growing a tree of their
            own from scratch is great fun and will help them to value
            these wonderful plants and understand their life cycle.<br>
            <br>
            There are two basic ways to grow a tree from seed: outdoors
            and indoors. The outdoor method is a little simpler for most
            native British trees, but the indoor approach allows
            children to observe the germination and early growth more
            closely. With either approach, the best time to start is in
            the autumn, when you can mount an expedition to collect
            plenty of seeds: acorns, nuts of various sorts, winged seeds
            such as those from ash and sycamore trees, cones from
            conifers, and berries from trees such as rowan and holly.
            Not every seed will germinate, so it is worth collecting
            perhaps half a dozen each of the varieties you want to try.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Preparation</u><br>
            In the case of cones and berries the seeds will need to be
            extracted first. Ripe (i.e. woody) cones will open and
            release their seeds if&nbsp; they are placed in a paper bag
            and kept somewhere warm for a few days. Berries can be
            squashed or cut open and the flesh washed away from the
            seeds. Nuts will germinate more readily if they are soaked
            first. Drop them into a container of water, discard any
            which float (they are probably sterile) and leave the rest
            to soak for a day or so.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Germination - outdoor method<br>
            </u>Most British trees require a period of cold before they
            will germinate. Try asking a child why they think this might
            be a good idea. (Hint: think what would happen to a young
            seedling if it started to grow straight away, in the
            autumn.) The easiest way to give the seeds the necessary
            cold treatment is to plant them outside. The winter should
            then do the trick. However, many seeds are eaten by rodents
            such as mice and squirrels, or by birds, so you will need to
            protect your seeds if you want them to escape. Plant several
            seeds of the same sort a couple of centimetres deep in a pot
            of compost, with drainage holes in the bottom, cover the pot
            with wire to keep animals and birds off, or place your pots
            in a larger container which you can cover. If you are trying
            several different species at once then be sure to label your
            pots so you know which is which. Then place the pots in a
            shady spot (the north side of your house is ideal) and keep
            an eye on them to ensure they do not dry out or become
            waterlogged. Then wait for early spring to see some
            seedlings emerge. <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            guide from the Woodland Trust gives a simple description of
            this method, and goes on to discuss what to do after your
            seeds have germinated.<u><br>
              <br>
              Germination - indoor method<br>
            </u>Germinating your seeds indoors avoids have to wait for
            spring, and allows children a closer look at the process of
            germination. The period of cold your seeds need to break
            their dormancy can be provided by your fridge. Seal them
            inside a transparent plastic bag, along with some damp paper
            towel, pop them into the fridge (<u>not</u> the freezer!)
            and inspect them every week or two for signs of germination,
            which could take up two or three months. Once you see a root
            emerging from one of the seeds you can pot it up right away,
            place it on a windowsill and treat it like a house plant for
            a few months as it develops. An alternative which allows
            children to watch the development of roots and shoots in
            more detail is to start its growth in a jar, as described in
            our <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="seedjar.html">seed jar</a>
            activity. Once the seedling has developed a few leaves you
            will need to plant it into a pot with potting compost so it
            can take up the nutrients it needs to grow. If you leave it
            too long then it may fail to survive the transfer,<br>
            <br>
            <u>Exotics</u><br>
            Not all tree seeds require cold treatment for germination.
            Those which grow in frost-free countries can be sown
            straight away indoors. Some of the best examples are citrus
            fruits. There is something especially intriguing for
            children in growing a tree from something they might eat, so
            an orange would be a good choice, but lemon, grapefruit or
            lime should work just as well. Soak the pips in water for a
            couple of hours before planting them 1-2 cm deep in potting
            compost. Fix a plastic bag over the top of the pot with a
            rubber band, keep it moist and place it somewhere warm (but
            not too close to a radiator). Pips which germinate will make
            good house plants, but children should not expect to be
            harvesting fruit from them! Advice on growing other plants
            from edible fruits can be found <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.oddbox.co.uk/blog/7-fruit-trees-you-can-grow-from-your-leftover-pits">here</a>.
            Apples and pears are other obvious choices, but will require
            cold treatment. <br>

            Your young trees can be grown on in pots outdoors (apart
            from exotics, which would not survive a British winter
            outdoors), and should be repotted as necessary if you want
            them to grow to full size. Once they reach a foot or so in
            height they can be planted out into the ground. You can do
            this at any time of year, but it will be very important to
            keep young trees well watered if you plant them out in
            summer. Bare root trees (the cheapest way to buy them if you
            are not growing them from seed) are usually planted in
            winter or early spring. If rabbits or deer are likely to
            visit, then you would be </font></font><font face="Arial"><font

            If you don't have room in your garden for a full grown tree
            then you might be able to find an opportunity to plant it
            out elsewhere. There may be local groups engaged in tree
            planting for the environment. There are also national
            programmes such as the <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            <br>
            Alternatively, if the root development of trees is
            restricted by a pot of modest size then they will not grow
            to full height and can look very attractive against a wall
            or in a courtyard. You will need to keep them from
            completely drying out, so a fairly shady spot is best, and
            they will need watering in hot weather. If you are feeling
            artistic and are happy to spend regular time on it, you
            could even turn your tree into a bonsai. Many sites, such as
