        <font face="Arial">Ponds are wonderful for wildlife and every
          garden should have one. You don't need a lot of space - even
          an old bowl sunk in the ground will provide a home for aquatic
          insects and amphibians, as well as being visited by birds,
          which can be watched drinking and bathing.<br>
          <br>
          Even if you already have a pond in the garden, children will
          get great fun out of building one of their very own, and you
          can be sure that pond life will appear quickly if there is
          another pond nearby.<br>

            Trusts and the RHS</a>, shows how to do it. Pick a spot
          which is not too shady, and not underneath a tree which will
          drop leaves into it in the autumn. Dig a hole in which to sink
          your container. Put some gravel and stones in the bottom. It
          is important to have one object which protrudes above the
          water surface so that any air-breathing creatures which visit
          the pond (e.g. frogs or newts) or might fall in (e.g. mice)
          can climb out again.<br>
          <br>
          It is best to fill the pond with rainwater. Can your young
          naturalist devise a way of channeling rain into their pond so
          as to fill it as quickly as possible? It is generally advised
          not to transfer in creatures, fish or mud from another pond in
          case disease is introduced. In any case, it is interesting to
          see what will arrive without any help from humans, and how
          long it will take. You could, however, buy a plant or two from
          a local nursery with an aquatics section. An underwater
          oxygenating plant will be good for the health of the pond and
          have the bonus that children can actually <i>see</i> the
          little bubbles of oxygen produced on a sunny day. It is best
          not to have fish in a wildlife pond, since they will eat
          insects, tadpoles etc, so the diversity of creatures in the
          pond will be reduced.<br>

          Recording the building of the pond and subsequent developments
          as life arrives there in a <a href="naturejournal.html">Nature






            Journal</a> will add to the fun. You could take some
          photographs which can be stuck into the journal. When it comes
          to identifying creatures and plants associated with ponds,
          links to a variety of identification guides, as well as to
          further detailed advice on building one, can be found <a
href="https://thousandponds.blogspot.com/p/identification-guides-and-help.html">here</a>.
          These guides may also be useful if you visit a pond or river
          on trips out with your grandchildren. </font><font
