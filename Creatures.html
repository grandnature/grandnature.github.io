                  perhaps the most exciting aspect of the natural world
                  and are always a source of fascination to children.
                  Even if you live in a town or city there are plenty to
                  be spotted and studied, especially birds and small
                  invertebrates (insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms,
                  spiders etc.).<br>
