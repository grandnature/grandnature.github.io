                exciting aspect of the natural world and are always a
                source of fascination to children. Even if you live in a
                town or city there are plenty to be spotted and studied,
                especially birds and small invertebrates (insects,
                molluscs, crustaceans, worms, spiders etc.).<br>

                pots with a magnifying lid it will be useful for several
                of the activities in this section.<br>
