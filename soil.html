        <font face="Arial"> As all gardeners know, good soil is one of
          the main secrets of growing good plants. Without soil, there
          would be very few plants on land at all. So, what is soil made
          of and where does it come from? A good way to start exploring
          this is to dig a hole in the garden. Depending&nbsp;on the
          location, there may be some organic material (dead&nbsp;leaves
          etc) on the surface, then some good dark soil, but further
          down you will encounter paler soil, most probably with a
          mixture of stones in clay or sand, and if you dig far enough
          you may hit solid rock. Soil is a mixture of mineral particles
          weathered from rocks and organic material from decaying plant
          material. <br>
          To see what your own soil is made of, take a large jar with a
          wide mouth and a screw-on lid (this will also be useful for
          the wormery project below) fill it about 1/3 of the way with
          soil, including material from the surface down to depth of
          6-12 inches, then top it most of the way up with warm water,
          screw the lid on and give it a good shake. Leave it a few
          hours to settle and you should find that you have several
          different layers. At the bottom will be any stones or gravel
          in the soil. Above this there may be a sand layer, then one or
          more soil layers. Any fine clay will remain suspended for a
          long time in the water, though fine clay particles should
          gradually settle out on top of the soil. Finally, some organic
          material may remain floating on the surface. The relative
          thickness of these layers will give an idea of the composition
          of your soil. <br>

          Worms make an important contribution to the health of the
          soil. They feed by eating soil and extracting bits of dead
          plant or animal material from it. In the process they mix up
          the soil with their burrowing and enrich it with humus by
          pulling leaves down into the soil. You can see this at work by
          setting up a wormery, as shown in the picture on the right,
          which is taken from <a moz-do-not-send="true"

          you need is a transparent (glass or plastic) container with
          vertical sides and a wide mouth. A large drinks bottle with
          the top cut off will work if you don't have a suitable vase or
          jar. Put some stones, gravel or sand in the bottom to provide
          drainage, then fill the container with soil, incorporating a
          few layers of sand. Place a few dead&nbsp;leaves on the
          surface and then add a few worms and watch what happens over
          the course of a few days. Your wormery needs to be kept in a
          cool dark place. Worms will avoid&nbsp;the light, so if you
          don't have a dark place then you should wrap dark paper round
          the jar, which you can remove to inspect their tunnels. Return
          your worms to the garden when you have finished watching them.

          Many other creatures can be found in the surface layers of
          soil. The richest collection can usually be found under trees,
          where there is plenty of leaf litter. One way of discovering
          what creatures live in this surface layer is to make a trap.
          Sink a jar in the ground with its mouth level with the ground,
          place a few leaves and twigs around the rim and then wait a
          few hours to see what falls into your trap. A magnifying glass
          will help you to study anything you catch, before returning it
          to the leaf litter. A simple identification guide to some of
          the most common "minibeasts", from the RSPB, can be found <a
href="http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/Images/MinibeastIDsheet_tcm9-384498.pdf">here</a>.
          Another method for studying creatures in the surface layers of
          soil is to collect a few scoops in a carrier bag and tip it
          little by little into a sieve on top of a white container.
          Creatures which fall through can be studied. You may find a
          small paintbrush useful for moving them gently around. You can
          encourage more creatures to fall through the sieve by shining
          a lamp onto the top of the material in it - creatures will
          move away from the light. You can keep your minibeasts for a
          few days if you provide them with a suitable home. What you
          need is a container with a lid in which you can punch a few
          holes. This should contain some damp soil with leaf litter and
          perhaps a little decaying wood and a stone, and should be kept
          out of bright light. You can then investigate which creatures
          move around, which will hide under a stone, which burrow into
          the soil, which seem to be interested in the decaying wood
          etc. <br>
