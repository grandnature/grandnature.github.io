      <font face="Arial"> The idea for this website arose from a sense
        of powerlessness in the face of the developing crisis of Climate
        Change. The impact of any actions we can take individually seems
        so small in comparison to the magnitude of the problem that it
        feels entirely hopeless. Reflecting on how we might have a
        larger impact, it struck me that the key lies with the young.
        They will inherit the mess we have created by our
        over-exploitation of the planet, and they need to be prepared to
        live life differently - to forego a lot of the overindulgence
        which has brought us to where we are now. Will they be prepared
        to do this? To live without the cheap flights, extravagant diet
        and throw-away culture which has increasingly characterised the
        past 50 years?<br>
        <br>
        It is more likely that the coming generations will be prepared
        to make these sacrifices if they have a reverence for the
        natural world. But here we hit the problem that many youngsters
        in the UK see less of Nature than did earlier generations. We
        are more urban nowadays, and spend more and more time living in
        the virtual world created by the internet. Here, then, is an
        opportunity for those of us who are retired. Many of us will
        have grandchildren, along with the time and resources to
        introduce them to Nature. Did you ever wish you could detach
        your grandchildren from the TV, smartphone or games box and get
        them doing something more meaningful? The aim of this collection
        of activities is to help you to do so.<br>
        <br>
        My hope is that many people will contribute their ideas and
        expertise to enlarge the collection. Please contact me at <a

        if you have an idea for such a contribution.<br>
