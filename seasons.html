        <font face="Arial">It is often said that in the UK we don't have
          a climate, we have weather. But of course this is not entirely
          true. The circle of the seasons is one of the most noticeable
          features of life. Although we might wish at times for
          perpetual summer, the contrast between the different seasons
          adds variety to life and is something to celebrate with
          children. It is also something to try to understand. The level
          at which you can do this obviously depends upon the age and
          inclination of the child.<br>
          <br>
          You could start by asking them what they notice about the
          difference between summer and winter. The most obvious
          difference is, of course, the temperature. So, <i>why</i>
          should it be colder in winter? Where does the heat come from?
          Well, the sun! And do they notice any difference between the
          sun in summer and winter? They probably haven't noticed that
          it gets higher in the sky in summer, but a little fishing will
          probably get them to recall the the days are longer in summer.
          This can lead to an interesting discussion about where the sun
          goes after dark. A globe is really useful at this point, but
          if you don't have one you can see pictures of the Earth as a
          ball in space at sites such <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/en/">this</a>
          NASA one, and you can use a ball (or a grapefruit) and a torch
          to illustrate the fact that when the sun shines on the Earth
          there is an illuminated side and a dark side. The Earth spins
          once round in 24 hours, so we move from the bright side to the
          dark side in that time. As we do this, the sun moves across
          the sky and disappears beneath the horizon.<br>
          <br>
          The seasons arise from the fact that the Earth's axis is
          tilted relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun, as
          shown in the graphic on the right. In our summer (on the left
          in the diagram) the north pole faces the sun, and so it is in
          sunlight throughout the day. In other words, the sun never
          sets at the north pole in summer. Conversely, in the winter
          the north pole spends all day in the dark. We are more than
          half-way towards the pole from the equator, so in the summer
          we spend a lot more time in sunlight (almost 17 hours) than in
          the winter (less than 8 hours). As a result of this, and the
          fact that the sun rises higher in the sky in summer, it is a
          lot warmer than in the winter.<br>

      <div align="left"><font face="Arial"> Even children who are too
          young to grasp the explanation above can understand that we
          see more of the sun in summer, and can appreciate the
          different character of each season and the way in which Nature
          responds to the seasons. If they keep a <a
            moz-do-not-send="true" href="naturejournal.html">Nature
            Journal</a>, then this is a great place to record changes
          through the year: when do the first spring bulbs appear? when
          do birds start building nests? when do leaves appear on the
          trees? when is it warm enough to eat outdoors? when do the
          leaves start to change colour? when do they fall? when is the
          first frost? <br>
          <br>
          If they don't keep a Nature Journal you could draw their
          attention to such changes by helping them set up a Season
          Scrap Book. For example, you could take photos of the same
          scene (perhaps in your garden) at different times of year and
          stick these in the book, so they can be compared. What
          differences can they see between these photos? They could add
          drawings to the scrap book, and stick things (e.g. leaves,
          feathers, pressed flowers) into it.<br>
          <br>
          Each season has its own special character, and sharing
          seasonal activities with children is a great way to help them
          appreciate the yearly cycle. Here are a few suggestions, you
          can find more online at sites such as <a
