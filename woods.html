        <font face="Arial">There are so many things to do or look for in
          a wood that the suggestions here are just a start. Deciduous
          or mixed woodland is the most interesting - dense, dark
          plantations of conifers are best avoided. If you have a nearby
          woodland, it is well worth visiting several times during the
          year, since you will see different things. For example, wild
          flowers are most abundant in woods in the early spring, before
          the tree canopy develops to shut out much of the light. The
          cool shade of a wood can be very welcome on a hot summer's
          day. Autumn is the time for seeds, fungi and colourful leaves.
          Some ideas are listed below and you can find others in our <a
            href="tree.html">Adopt a tree</a> activity.<br>

        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial">One of the most enjoyable activities
              for children in woodland is a <u>scavenger hunt</u>. It
              is best if you can visit the wood in advance and make up a
              list of items they might be able to find there. For
              example: a leaf as big as a hand, prickly leaf, hairy
              leaf, partly eaten leaf, cone, berry, feather, acorn,
              white flower, flat stone, seed pod, twig shaped like an
              "r", etc. Each child then gets a copy of the list and they
              set out with a bag or backpack to see how many they can
              collect before you call time.</font></li>

          <li><font face="Arial">What are the main types of tree in the
              wood? You can use the <a
href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/">
                A-Z guide to British trees</a> from the Woodland Trust
              to identify them. Do the most common trees differ between
              the middle and edge of the wood? If so, can you think why
              this might be?</font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">Take <a
href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/how-to/make-things/how-to-make-a-bark-rubbing/">
                bark rubbings</a> from different types of tree, using a
              thick wax crayon used side-on and paper which does not
              tear easily. Compare the bark pattern from different tree
              types. These rubbings can be trimmed down and stuck in a <a
                href="naturejournal.html">Nature Journal</a> labelled
              with the tree type. </font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">If you can visit the wood regularly
              then it is interesting to note the changes in the
              different tree species through the year. Which trees are
              the first to produce leaves, and when does this happen?
              Which trees have flowers and which have catkins? What sort
              of seeds and fruits do the different trees produce? Take a
              few home and plant them in a pot outdoors to see if they
              germinate. If they do, they could be grown on in a shallow
              pot as a sort of bonsai. Which trees have the most
              colourful leaves in the autumn? When do most of them fall?
              Does this vary much between different types of tree? This
              is all excellent material for a <a

          <li><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">The age of a tree
                can be roughly estimated from the circumference of the
                main trunk. A rule of thumb is one year of age for every
                2.5 cm of girth. Of course this rule varies with the
                type of the tree. A calculator which allows for this can
                be found <a
                  href="http://www.tree-guide.com/tree-age-calculator">here</a>.
                Who can find the tree in the wood with the thickest
                trunk? Use a tape measure or string to measure its
                circumference and then work out its age.<br>
              </font></font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">Use a magnifying glass to study
              "minibeasts" living on the trees or in the leaf litter
              underneath. A pale coloured pot or tray and a paintbrush
              will be useful to allow creatures to be gently separated
              from leaves or bark and studied. The Woodland Trust has
              some useful guides <a
href="https://www.treetoolsforschools.org.uk/activitymenu/?cat=minibeasts">here</a>
              which may help you to identify some of the creatures you
              find.</font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">What birds can you see in the woods? It
              is often much easier to hear them than to see them -
              binoculars may help. The Woodland Trust is also a good
              source for identifying <a
href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/animals/birds/">
                woodland birds</a>.</font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">In the autumn, you can go on a fungus
              hunt. Some grow on trees, especially old ones, some are
              found on the ground. Fallen logs are an especially rich
              source of fungi, which speed the process of decay. Of
              course some fungi are very poisonous, so you will want to
              emphasize that they should not be touched. <a
href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/fungi-and-lichens/">Here</a>
              is a useful identification guide. </font></li>
          <br>
          <li><font face="Arial">Finally, there are many games which can
              be played in woods. Hide and seek is an obvious one. In
              addition to the basic game, many variants are possible. <a
href="https://earlyimpactlearning.com/15-hide-and-seek-variations-twists-on-the-classic-game/">Here</a>
              is a description of some of them. Another fun activity for
              kids is to <a
                href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2019/10/how-to-build-a-den/">
                build a den</a>, using fallen branches and other natural
              woodland materials.<br>
