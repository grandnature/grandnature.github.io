              <font size="+2">Plants are the powerhouses of life on
                Earth. They capture energy from the sun, absorb carbon
                dioxide and generate the oxygen which enables animal
                life to exist. They can also be very beautiful, and
                profoundly calming. It is easy and very satisfying for
                children to grow a plant of their own, and in doing so
                they can appreciate the way that plants work. Many young
                children will enjoy "helping" in the garden, and in
                doing so may develop a life-long enjoyment of gardening
                and getting out into Nature.</font><br>
