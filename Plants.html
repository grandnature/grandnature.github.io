                of life on Earth. They capture energy from the sun,
                absorb carbon dioxide and generate the oxygen which
                enables animal life to exist. They can also be very
                beautiful, and profoundly calming. It is easy and very
                satisfying for children to grow a plant of their own,
                and in doing so they can appreciate the way that plants
                work. Many young children will enjoy "helping" in the
                garden, and in doing so may develop a life-long
                enjoyment of gardening and getting out into Nature.</font><br>
