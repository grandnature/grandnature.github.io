                the scattered light from it which gives the sky its blue
                colour, and a rich variety of clouds. At night, it is
                transformed and we see the stars, planets and moon, as
                well as man-made satellites, and on occasion shooting
                stars (meteors). In between, we have the glories of the
                sunrise and the sunset.<br>

                what it has to offer.<br>
