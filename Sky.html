                  dominated by the sun, the scattered sunlight which
                  gives the sky its blue colour, and a rich variety of
                  clouds. At night, it is transformed and we see the
                  stars, planets and moon, as well as man-made
                  satellites and, on occasion, shooting stars (meteors).
                  In between, we have the glories of the sunrise and the
                  sunset.<br>
