          <font size="+1">A creative and enjoyable things for children
            to do with natural materials they forage is to make a
            collage. Leaves, flowers, seeds, twigs and even shells and
            small stones can be used. Some fairly thick paper or card
            makes a suitable backing. The card from old cereal boxes is
            ideal, and free! Painting the backdrop before sticking
            materials onto it may provide a more attractive picture.
            Fresh leaves and flowers can be used, but they will dry out
            and curl after a few days. For a more durable result, they
            can be pressed first. Sandwich the items between two sheets
            of paper and place in a flower press if you have one, or
            just under a pile of books. The process takes a couple of
            weeks or more, so you do lose some of the spontaneity. PVA
            glue is good for sticking them to the backing sheet.
            Creatures, such as bugs and animals make good subjects, as
            do people - they could try a self-portrait, for example.
            Felt tips can be used to add to the picture, as in the fish
            example above. The natural materials have simply been laid
            on top here, rather than stuck on.<br>

            Using a paper plate and two sheets of sticky-backed plastic
            you can make a lovely <i>suncatcher</i>, using leaves or
            flowers, which children can hang in their bedroom window.

            Collage can even be used to help with early learning of
            numbers by challenging a child to make pictures including 1,
            2, 3... leaves.<br>
