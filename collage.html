        <font face="Arial"> <font size="+1">A creative and enjoyable
            thing for children to do with natural materials they forage
            is to make a collage. Leaves, flowers, seeds, twigs and even
            shells and small stones can be used. Some fairly thick paper
            or card makes a suitable backing. The card from old cereal
            boxes is ideal, and free! Painting the backdrop before or
            after sticking materials onto it may provide a more
            attractive picture. Fresh leaves and flowers can be used,
            but they will dry out and curl after a few days. For a more
            durable result, they can be pressed first. Sandwich the
            items between two sheets of paper and place in a flower
            press if you have one, or just under a pile of books. The
            process takes a couple of weeks or more, so you do lose some
            of the spontaneity. PVA glue is good for sticking them to
            the backing sheet. Creatures, such as bugs and animals make
            good subjects, as do people - they could try a
            self-portrait, for example. Felt tips can be used to add to
            the picture.<br>

                Another variant on the collage theme is to make a name
                plate, which the child can hang on their bedroom door.
                Again, remember that flowers and leaves will last only a
                few days unless they are pressed, but this may not
                matter if the child enjoys making the name plate and
                displaying it for a day or two.</font></font><br>

            Using a paper plate and two sheets of sticky-backed plastic
            you can make a lovely <i>suncatcher</i>, using leaves or
            flowers, which children can hang in their bedroom window.

            Collage can even be used to help with early learning of
            numbers by challenging a child to make pictures including 1,
            2, 3... leaves, petals or shells. <font face="Arial"><font
