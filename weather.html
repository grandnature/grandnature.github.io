        <font face="Arial">You can have an interesting conversation with
          a child along the following lines:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#993399">Where does the rain come
            from?</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#3333ff">The sky!</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#993399">But where in the sky? /
            What do you notice about the sky when it is raining?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#3333ff">From the clouds.</font><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; How do you think the water gets into the
            clouds?<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#000000">This can lead on to the fact that
              water evaporates - especially when it is sunny. You could
              get them to do a little experiment, by wetting a
              non-porous surface (a plate or tile, for example) and
              seeing how long it takes to dry out if left in the sun.
              Where has the water gone? It disappears into the air as
              water vapour, which is invisible. <br>
              <br>
              How does it form a cloud? On a cold day they can form
              their own cloud simply by breathing - the water vapour in
              their breath condenses into tiny water drops when it hits
              the cold air. Notice how much it looks like a small cloud.
              That's all a cloud is - a lot of little water droplets. If
              it's not a cold day, then you can produce a cloud by
              boiling a kettle. If you place a cool surface in the steam
              you can show them that water condenses onto it. It gets
              colder with height (by about 1C every 150 metres) so water
              vapour condenses if it rises high enough, forming clouds.
              When enough water builds up in a cloud the droplets grow
              heavier and fall as rain.<br>
              <br>
              Clouds can be divided into different types and older
              children could try to identify them. You can find a useful
              identification guide from the Met Office <a
href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/clouds/cloud-spotting-guide">here</a>.
              Which types of clouds produce rain? Younger children could
              draw a picture (e.g. of your house) and stick on some
              cotton wool for clouds.<br>
              <br>
              Wind is another important feature of the weather. If you
              have a weather vane in the garden then children can use
              this to see which way the wind is blowing. If not, they
              could make a simple weather vane of their own - see <a
                href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Wind-Vane">this</a>
              WikiHow page for instructions. This vane will not be
              weather-proof, but they can carry it outside to make a
              measurement. You will need a compass to orient the vane,
              unless you already know which way is north in your garden,
              or you could use the fact that the sun is in the south at
              midday (or at 1pm in British Summertime).<br>
              <br>
              Here are some questions for them to explore with their
              weather vane. From which direction does the wind blow most
              of the time? Does it feel colder when the wind is in the
              north and warmer when it comes from the south? Does it
              ever blow from the east, and how does it feel then? Do
              clouds always seem to move downwind? (It is possible for
              the wind at height to differ in direction from the wind on
              the ground.) You can judge which clouds are highest by
              seeing how fast they move in the wind - the higher the
              cloud, the slower it will seem to move. This is especially
              striking on a day when high cirrus and low cumulus are
              present in the sky together. Of course, investigating the
              wind could naturally lead on to a bit of kite flying!<br>
