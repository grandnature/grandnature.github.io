        <font face="Arial">Birds are the easiest creatures to spot in a
          garden and in many ways the most interesting, since they are
          always on the move. You can ensure a good complement of birds
          in your garden by providing them with food, water and shelter.
          Birds will naturally catch children's attention, but you can
          encourage them to take more notice by involving them in
          bird-related activities. The RSPB provides a wealth of useful
          information on birds, and many of the links on this page take
          you to locations on their web site.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Food</b></u><br>
          A bird table is not essential, but it will provide a focus for
          activity, helps to keep food off the ground where it might
          attract rats, and if sited fairly close to the house will
          ensure a good view of feathered visitors. You can easily buy
          one, or save a bit of money and perhaps engage
          practically-minded children in the enterprise my <a

            scraps</a>, such as bread, fats, cheese and fruit. Children
          can enjoy making their own gooey bird food mixes, which can be
          smeared onto cones or stuffed into coconut shells and hung
          from the table or from tree branches. See the guide <a

          There is a special interest in watching to see what is
          attracted to food you have made for yourself.<br>
          <br>
          Of course birds will also take natural food from plants in
          your garden. Shrubs and trees with berries, such as rowan,
          hawthorn and pyracantha are a favourite, teasels will often
          attract goldfinches. BBC Gardeners World provides a list of
          some bird-friendly food plants <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/top-10-plants-for-birds/">here</a>.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Water</b></u><br>
          Birds need water for drinking and bathing and the easiest way
          to provide it is in a bird bath. Any shallow container heavy
          enough to resist taking off on a windy day will do the trick.
          If your garden is frequented by cats then a raised bath will
          be best. It is entertaining to watch birds bathing, so site
          your bath somewhere you can easily see them. An alternative to
          a bird bath is a pond with a shallow side. This has many other
          advantages for wildlife, especially insects and amphibians,
          and need not be very large. See our <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="minipond.html">Minipond</a> activity for more
          information on making a small pond.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Shelter and nesting</b></u><br>
          For most of the year many birds sleep at night sitting on a
          branch somewhere they feel safe - this is called "roosting".
          However, during the spring birds pair up and build a nest in
          which they lay eggs and raise their young. If you want to
          observe nesting birds it is worth installing a nest box in
          your garden. This is best fixed to a tree trunk where it is
          easily visible but out of direct sunlight (north- or
          east-facing is best). The classic nest box with a small hole
          for entry is most likely to be used by blue or great tits.
          Larger birds, like blackbirds, will build a nest in bushes or
          trees. Evergreen shrubs provide especially popular locations,
          and will also be used for roosting outside the nesting season.
          Children will enjoy watching birds collect nesting material,
          and later food to feed their young. A pair of binoculars will
          allow a closer look, once they have got the hang of using
          them.<br>

          <u><b>Identifying and recording birds</b></u><br>
          The Wildlife Trusts have compiled <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/gardenbirds">this</a>
          useful short guide to ten of the most common garden birds.
          However, you are very likely to see other visitors from time
          to time. A more comprehensive guide from the RSPB <a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/identify-a-bird/">here</a>
          will generate a list of candidates based on size, colour,
          location etc. Children can be encouraged to draw some of the
          birds they see, either from life (tricky since they keep
          moving) or from the online identification pictures. If they
          keep a <a href="naturejournal.html">Nature Journal</a> then
          this provides an ideal place to make such drawings and to
          record any interesting behaviour, such as nesting. The RSPB
          holds an annual garden Birdwatch in late January. It is easy
          to take part and children can help. You just need to set aside
          one hour and count all the birds which land in your garden in
          that time. You can find instructions <a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/everything-you-need-to-know-about-big-garden-birdwatch/">here</a>
          and the results from this year's birdwatch are reported <a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/">here</a>.
          Taking part in this might motivate children to do a little
          advanced study in how to recognise common garden birds.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, it is fun to try to identify birds by their song. The
          calls of many of the most common birds can be found <a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-songs/what-bird-is-that/">here</a>
          - you may be surprised how many of these are familiar.
          Certainly I was! If you have children sleeping over with you
          you might even consider taking them out into the garden early
          to listen to the dawn chorus, which reaches its peak in late
          spring.<br>
