          <font size="+1">Mobiles provide a fun way of displaying found
            natural objects, and also an opportunity for artwork. Find a
            stick with a bit of character and then hunt around for
            interesting items to hang from it. Cones, seed pods,
            berries, feathers and leaves will all work. If the mobile is
            to last then it is best to avoid items which will dry out
            quickly, like flowers. However, both leaves and flowers will
            last much better if they are pressed first. A simple mobile,
            like that shown on the left, is easy to construct. Cotton
            will do very well unless the whole thing gets too heavy.
            It's best to tie the down-strings to the stick first - this
            can be a bit fiddly, so youngsters may need some help - and
            then to attach them to the items. Once this is done, you
            will find that there is always a point on the stick where it
            balances (physicists call this the "centre of mass"), so you
            tie the suspension thread at this point. This could then be
            fixed to the ceiling in a child's room, so they have their
            very own home made mobile.<br>
            <br>
            Autumn is an especially good time to find natural objects
            for a mobile. However, there are other possibilities. A trip
            to the beach may provide plenty of items for a "sea mobile".
            Shells may require a small hole drilling in them so that
            they can be suspended, small pieces of sea-worn wood,
            colourful stones or pieces of sea glass will look
            attractive. Mobiles can also celebrate the <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="seasons.html">seasons</a>,
            and specific festivals. For example an egg mobile for
            Easter, and holly, ivy, mistletoe and stars for Christmas.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Children will enjoy making mobiles more colourful using
            paints, or by adding coloured beads to the strings. They can
            even make their own beads from clay and paint them, as
            described <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            <br>
            More ambitious mobiles can include more than one layer. In
            this case it is best to start at the bottom and work your
            way up to the top layer. Further ideas and guides from
            around the world for making different kinds of mobiles can
