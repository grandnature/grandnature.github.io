        <font face="Arial">Many small creatures will hide from
          predators, and from the drying effect of the sun, under stones
          and logs lying on the ground. There is something exciting
          about peeking under a log to see what you can find
          there.&nbsp; This can also form the basis for a little
          experiment.<br>
          <br>
          Take a set of fairly flat items at least 6 inches across -
          these could be stones, pieces of wood, or even bricks or
          tiles. Place these on the ground in different locations in the
          garden. Pick different types of location - perhaps about four
          different ones - for example, a very damp place, a dry spot,
          under a tree, on top of leaves, on grass. Your grandchild
          could write a number on the top of each object, so as to keep
          track of which is which.<br>
          <br>
          Then come back at intervals to see what can be found
          underneath each of them. A magnifying glass will be useful,
          though your grandchildren's eyes are probably a good deal
          sharper than yours! The picture on the left shows some of the
          life you might find there - woodlice are very likely
          (especially under wood), along with various sorts of beetles,
          millipedes, centipedes, slugs, worms, ants, earwigs and so
          forth. A simple identification guide to some of the most
          common "minibeasts", from the RSPB, can be found <a
            href="http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/Images/MinibeastIDsheet_tcm9-384498.pdf">here</a>.
          If you are really lucky you may even find a small toad or a
          newt.<br>
          <br>
          You might also find eggs. What creatures have laid them? One
          way to find out would be to collect them, put them in a jam
          jar on a little soil or leaf litter, and wait to see what
          emerges. You might want to put a lid or a paper cap on the jar
          to ensure that nothing escapes. It should be kept in a fairly
          dark and cool place.<br>
          <br>
          In the spirit of a scientist, an older child can be encouraged
          to look for differences between the life found under objects
          in different locations. What does this tell you about the
          creatures? If one of the objects is placed on grass, then the
          grass will turn yellow. Why would this be? Here is an
          educational opportunity to discuss that plants get their
          energy from the sun, and that the job is done by a chemical
          called chlorophyll, which is green.<br>
