        <font face="Arial">Everyone loves a rainbow! They have
          impressive scale, great beauty and an air of mystery. If you
          chase after one it will recede from you, so you can never find
          the pot of gold at its end. They also provide a wonderful
          opportunity for both art and science. The colours are always
          in the same order: red on top, then orange, yellow, green,
          blue, indigo and violet - ROYGBIV - though you may struggle to
          distinguish the difference between the last two. Children will
          enjoy drawing or painting one - coloured pencils are easiest -
          and this will help them to recognise that the order of the
          colours is not random.<br>
          <br>
          At some times rainbows arc much higher in the sky than they do
          at others. To understand why this should be, you need some
          scientific understanding of what is going on. A rainbow is
          formed when sunlight bounces inside a raindrop and reflects
          back to you. So, you always need to have your back to the sun
          to see one. What is going on is shown in the diagram below. <img

            hspace="10" height="275" border="2">White light is actually
          made up from a combination of many different colours (all the
          "colours of the rainbow"). When light enters water (or glass)
          at an angle it is bent, in a process called <i>refraction</i>.
          However, blue light is bent more than red light, so the
          colours are separated out to form a <i>spectrum</i>. If this
          is happening in a raindrop then the light can bounce off the
          back of the drop and come back at a particular angle (about 41
          degrees from the incoming sunlight) with its colour separated.
          So, the rainbow would actually be a circle about a point
          directly opposite the sun, but of course the sun is above the
          horizon, so the centre of the rainbow is <i>below</i> the
          opposite horizon and you see only the part of the circle which
          is above the ground. The lower in the sky the sun is, the
          bigger the arc of the rainbow. The largest rainbows will
          therefore be seen early or late in the day. <br>
          <br>
          You can make your own rainbow! All you need do on a sunny day
          is to stand with your back to the sun and sprinkle water
          droplets from a fine spray on a hose into the air ahead of
          you. You may even be able to see that the rainbow forms a full
          circle centred on the point directly opposite the sun. You can
          also make a rainbow indoors if the sun is shining. To do this
          you need a bowl of water and a small mirror, which will fit
          inside it. Prop the mirror up so that it is tilted, with some
          of it sticking out of the water, but most of it submerged.
          Then place your rainbow-maker on a sunny windowsill, so that
          the sun shines through the water onto the mirror and hold a
          sheet of white paper or card above the bowl where it can
          "catch" the rainbow. Try different distances above the bowl to
          get the best result. This may also work in a darkened room
          with a bright torch, but the results are unlikely to be as
          good as using sunlight.<br>

          may sometimes see a double rainbow, as shown in the picture on
          the left. The outer rainbow is much dimmer than the main bow,
          and so is only likely to be visible when the main rainbow is a
          very bright one. Notice that the colours in the second bow are
          reversed, with red on the <i>inside</i>. This outer rainbow
          is produced by light which reflects twice off the inside of
          the raindrops, rather than just once. The extra reflection
          reverses the colours and also loses a lot of light, which
          explains why it is so much fainter.<br>
