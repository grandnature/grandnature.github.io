        <font face="Arial">The Sun and the Moon appear almost exactly
          the same size in the sky. In reality the sun is far bigger
          than the Earth (about 110 times larger in diameter), whilst
          the Moon is considerably (about 3.6 times) smaller than Earth.
          However, the Sun is much further away, so that they appear
          almost the same size, and when the Moon moves directly in
          front of the Sun it can produce a solar eclipse, as seen in
          the picture.<br>
          <br>
          The Sun moves across the sky every day. It is commonly thought
          that it rises in the east and sets in the west, but this is
          only true in spring and autumn - in summer it runs roughly NE
          to NW, and in winter SE to SW. However it always lies in the
          south in the middle of the day. Knowing all this, you can use
          it to find your way around on a sunny day.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to ask children where they think the Sun
          goes at night. If you have a globe and a torch you can show
          them that what is really happening is that it only illuminates
          half of the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis, and when we
          are on the dark side we cannot see it. When we pass through
          the edge of the shadow we will be experiencing a sunrise or
          sunset.<br>
          <br>
          You can also use a globe and torch in a darkened room to
          demonstrate the phases of the Moon. The Moon is illuminated by
          the Sun and the amount of bright disc you see depends on the
          angle from which you are viewing it, which changes through the
          month as the Moon orbits the Earth. Why does the Sun not show
          phases like the Moon?<br>
          <br>
          The Sun warms the Earth and is ultimately the source of energy
          for all life on Earth. It is also the power source for the
          weather - there would be no wind or rain if it were not for
          the Sun. The question of where <a href="rain.html">rain</a>
          comes from is another interesting conversation to have with
          children.<br>
