      <div align="left"> <font face="Arial">A good magnifyng glass can
          open up a whole new micro-world for children. It does this in
          two ways: most obviously, it makes things look bigger, but
          there is also the effect of just concentrating attention on
          small details which the eye might usually just pass over.<br>
          <br>
          The strength of magnifying glasses is commonly expressed in
          terms a of a magnification factor - for example 5x or 2x. In
          general, higher strength magnifiers tend to be smaller, since
          the fatter lenses required for high magnification are easier
          to achieve in a smaller size. Higher magnifications also tend
          to experience more optical distortion. My suggestion would be
          to go for a real glass lens (clearer and less likely to
          scratch than plastic) with a diameter of 6-8cm and magnifying
          power between 3 and 10. You should be able to buy a perfectly
          decent magnifier for Â£10 or less.<br>
          <br>
          The first thing to do with a magnifier is to play with it. A
          little obvious safety advice first: NEVER look at the sun
          through it - in fact don't look directly at the sun anyway, it
          can seriously damage your eyes. Also, as we soon discovered
          when I was a child, strong sunlight focussed to a point
          through a magnifier can burn, and is quite capable of setting
          fire to paper. Children are bound to want to try this, so you
          might as well get them to do it whilst you are watching.<br>
          <br>
          Now start by holding the glass close to your eye and approach
          a small object, or some writing. You will find that there is a
          best distance from the object at which the image they see is
          nice and sharp and magnified. If you hold the glass there and
          move your eye back, the magnification will stay roughly the
          same. This is the best way to use a magnifying glass to
          enlarge objects. Now try something different - place the glass
          close to your eye and look through it at a fairly distant
          object (a few metres away will do, but you could try a tree).
          It should look fairly unmagnified, but probably rather
          blurred. Now move the glass slowly away from you to arms
          length. What do you see as you do this? You will need physics
          at A level or above to explain why this happens, but it is fun
          to experience it anyway. Once you have tried for yourself, you
          will be better able to introduce it to children.<br>
          <br>
          Next they can start to explore the world with the magnifier. A
          good place to start is to examine the back of their own hand.
          Can they see little hairs? Veins? What about patterns in the
          skin itself? Turning the hand over, can they see their
          fingerprints? Look at all the little lines on the palm of the
          hand. Do different people have different lines?<br>
          <br>
          It is worth taking a magnifying glass on trips into the
          countryside or to a <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="beachcombing.html">beach</a>, where it will help to
          sharpen children's appreciation of natural objects. However,
          at home the garden will provide many interesting things to
          study. <br>
          <br>
          The obvious place to start is with <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="flowers.html">flowers</a>. <img
            moz-do-not-send="true" src="Images/dandelionpollen.jpg"
            alt="dandelion pollen grains" height="368" width="314"
            vspace="10" hspace="20" border="2" align="right">Can they
          see the stamens and the pollen grains on their surface? You
          can explain that these are sticky and attach themselves to the
          legs and body of flying insects which visit a flower, so they
          can be transferred to another flower where they will fertilise
          the eggs contained in the base of the flower, forming seeds.
          If a child brushes a finger against the stamens they should
          find that pollen grains will stick to it. If their eyesight is
          very good, they might just be able to see the shape of the
          pollen grains through their magnifier - though a microscope is
          really required to see details. The grains are often
          beautiful, and their form varies a lot from one type of plant
          to another. The image on the right shows pollen grains from a
          dandelion. The small spikes on the surface help to make them
          sticky. You could encourage children to perfrom the role of a
          bee, by moving pollen from one flower to another using a soft
          paintbrush.<br>
          <br>
          Other features of plants to examine through a magnifying glass
          include veins in the leaves, which carry fluids round a plant,
          in a similar way to the veins and arteries which transport
          blood around our bodies (though of course there is no heart to
          pump the fluid round in a plant). Many plants will also show
          fine hairs on their stems and leaves, and also on their roots,
          where they help to take up water and nutrients from the soil.<br>
          <br>
        </font><font face="Arial">Insects and other invertebrates
          (woodlice, spiders, centipedes, worms etc) - often called
          "minibeasts" - look much more exciting through a magnifying
          glass, since this reveals the structure and texture of their
          bodies. First you need to find your minibeasts. One good way
          is to <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="lifeunderneath.html">turn


            over stones or logs</a> and see what creatures are hiding
          underneath them. You can also make a simple <a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/kids--schools/teaching-resources/make-a-pitfall-trap.pdf">pitfall




            trap</a>, using an empty plastic pot, such as a yoghurt pot.
          This can be set into a hole in the garden so that passing
          creatures fall in, or you can use bait (such a small piece of
          fruit) to attract them. You could try different baits, to see
          whether this affects what you catch. Be sure to check your
          trap regularly, so any creatures it catches will not starve or
          drown. You can also see what creatures you can find in soil or
          leaf litter, and in summer you can use a <i>sweep net</i> to
          find what creatures live in tall grass and other wild plants.
          A fine gauze fishing net will work well, or you can <a

          face="Arial">an old pillowcase and a wire coat hanger. Sweep
          it through the tops of plants and see what you catch!<br>
          <br>
          Once you have some minibeasts you can study them with your
          magnifying glass. A white plastic container, such as a
          margarine tub, is ideal to hold your minibeast for study. Does
          it have legs? How many? Can you see a mouth? Antennae? Does
          the body have separate sections? Can you identify it? The
          Woodland Trust has some useful guides <a
href="https://www.treetoolsforschools.org.uk/activitymenu/?cat=minibeasts">here</a>
          which may help you. Children may want to keep minibeasts in a
          home, such as a jar with a perforated lid. It is not a good
          idea to keep them for long, or they will probably die, and it
          is important to provide them with food and shelter and to keep
          them somewhere cool and shady. Children who keep a <a
            moz-do-not-send="true" href="naturejournal.html">Nature
            Journal</a> can draw pictures of the creatures they find in
          their journal.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to living things, children may enjoy taking a
          closer look at the non-biological world. What does the
          magnifier reveal about sand (are the grains all similar in
          shape and colour, or do they vary? are they smooth or jagged?)
          and <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="soil.html">soil</a> (can
          they see mineral grains, fibres, tiny creatures?)? Crystals,
          such as grains of salt or sugar are also worth looking at. Can
          they see the shape of them? A glass of water placed in the
          freezer for half an hour will start to grow ice crystals on
          its surface, which will look beautiful through a magnifier. A
          ground frost in winter provides an opportunity to marvel at
          the tiny ice crystals on blades of grass, though they will
          need to take their magnifier outdoors, since the frost will
          rapidly melt if brought indoors. You can also <a

            your own</a> crystals using salt or sugar and see what shape
          they are, and many crystal growing kits are available
          commercially.<br>
