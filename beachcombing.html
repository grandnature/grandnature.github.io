            Where the sea meets the land all sorts of treasures can be
            washed up, and collecting some of these will fascinate
            children and adults alike. All you really need are a bag (a
            backpack is especially useful) or bucket and sharp eyes. If
            you take a bag for litter too, then you can also fulfill a
            useful social function, and teach children to look after the
            environment, by performing a mini beach clean - especially
            removing items which may be dangerous to wildlife such as
            plastic carrier bags. Depending on the nature of the beach,
            you might want to take a net (useful in rock pools) or a
            trowel with which to dig up creatures which may live under
            the surface of sand or mud. Obviously you should be aware of
            the tide, which can roll in very quickly on flat beaches,
            and avoid any danger of being overtaken or cut off by it.<br>
            <br>
            Here are some of the things you might find:<br>
          </font></font>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Shells - some have
                  beautiful colours and patterning, some may be damaged,
                  showing their internal structure, some may be
                  encrusted with barnacles.</font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Pebbles - small
                  pieces of rock, often smoothed into wonderfully
                  tactile rounded shapes by the grinding action of the
                  sea. You may also find "sea glass" pieces of glass
                  (often brightly coloured) smoothed into gems by the
                  sea.<br>
                </font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Driftwood - there is
                  a special quality to wood which has been smoothed and
                  bleached by the sea.</font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Seaweed - bladder
                  wrack, with its distinctive bubbles (which cause the
                  fonds to float upward in the water) is especially
                  common, but there are many other types.<br>
                </font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Egg cases from
                  dogfish, rays and sharks ("mermaid's purses") or from
                  dog whelks (looking rather like dried-up sponges) and
                  other creatures.</font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Crab shells,
                  cuttlefish bones, sea urchin skeletons.</font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Live molluscs
                  (mussels, limpets, winkles, whelks etc) crabs and
                  shrimps, as well as </font></font><font size="+1"><font
                  face="Arial"><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">starfish

                      and jellyfish which may have become stranded.<br>
                    </font></font></font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Worm casts - a sign
                  of life beneath the sand.</font></font></li>
            <li><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Tracks in sand or mud
                  - of birds and worms, as well as dogs and people.</font></font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">If you want help
                identifying some of the things you may find, there are
                some web sites which may help - for example <a
                  href="https://www.lincstrust.org.uk/wildlife/identify/beachcombing">this

                  one</a> from the Lincolnshire wildlife trust - and
                there are some excellent books, such as "The Essential
                Guide to Beachcombing and the Strandline" by Trewhella
                and Hatcher, which will give much more information.<br>
              </font></font></p>
          <p><font size="+1"><font face="Arial">What to do with the
                material scavenged from the beach? Live creatures should
                be replaced where they were found after taking a good
                look at them, and possibly making a drawing or taking a
                photo. However, non-living items can be used in many
                ways. For example, they could be used to assemble a "sea
                picture", on the beach, or taken home for display on a
                nature table, to make a small "sea garden" or stuck on
                card to make a collage.<br>
