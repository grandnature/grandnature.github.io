                  an opportunity for all sorts of fun and games, and for
                  broadening children's experience of the natural world.
                  Woods, rivers, hills and of course the coast, all hold
                  their own special fascination. Older children may
                  grumble about being taken for walks in the
                  countryside, but experiences of this sort when they
                  are young often lead to a taste for natural places
                  when they grow up. By exposing children to the beauty
                  of Nature you may bequeath them a lifetime of
                  pleasure.</font><br>
