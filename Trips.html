                sorts of fun and games, and for broadening children's
                experience of the natural world. Woods, rivers, hills
                and of course the coast, all hold their own special
                fascination. Older children may grumble about being
                taken for walks in the countryside, but experiences of
                this sort when they are young often lead to a taste for
                natural places when they grow up. By exposing children
                to the beauty of Nature you may bequeath them a lifetime
                of pleasure.<br>
